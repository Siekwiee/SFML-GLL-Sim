# 2-to-4 Decoder Circuit
# Takes 2-bit input (A, B) and activates one of 4 outputs
#
# Truth table:
#   A  B | Y0  Y1  Y2  Y3
#   0  0 |  1   0   0   0
#   0  1 |  0   1   0   0
#   1  0 |  0   0   1   0
#   1  1 |  0   0   0   1

IN A, B
OUT Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3

# Y0 = NOT A AND NOT B
AND a1(NOT(A), NOT(B)) -> Y0

# Y1 = NOT A AND B
AND a2(NOT(A), B) -> Y1

# Y2 = A AND NOT B
AND a3(A, NOT(B)) -> Y2

# Y3 = A AND B
AND a4(A, B) -> Y3
