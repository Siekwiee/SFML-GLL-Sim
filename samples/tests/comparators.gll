# Comparator Gates Test
# LT (Less Than), GT (Greater Than), EQ (Equal)
# These compare integer values from CV outputs of counters

IN countUp, countDown, resetUp, loadDown
OUT upDone, downDone, upIsLess, upIsGreater, upIsEqual

# Two counters to compare
CTU counterUp("10", countUp, resetUp) -> upDone, cvUp
CTD counterDown("10", countDown, loadDown) -> downDone, cvDown

# Compare the two counter values
# upIsLess is HIGH when counterUp's CV < counterDown's CV
LT lessThan(cvUp, cvDown) -> upIsLess

# upIsGreater is HIGH when counterUp's CV > counterDown's CV
GT greaterThan(cvUp, cvDown) -> upIsGreater

# upIsEqual is HIGH when counterUp's CV == counterDown's CV
EQ equalTo(cvUp, cvDown) -> upIsEqual
