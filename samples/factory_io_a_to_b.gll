# Factory IO "From A to B" Sample
# 
# Modbus Mapping:
# INPUT_0  : Sensor at the end of conveyor (triggers when part arrives)
# INPUT_1  : Factory IO "Running" status (high when simulation is active)
# OUTPUT_0 : Conveyor motor
#
# Logic: Run the conveyor if Factory IO is running AND the part hasn't reached the sensor yet.
